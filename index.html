            <h1 class="h1"><b>Energy</b></h1>
            <p>Energy is the capacity to do work and is required for life processes. An energy resource is something that can produce heat, power life, move objects, or produce electricity.</p>
            <p>Energy Conservation is the agenda of saving energy for mother earth. As a part of this natural environment, we all are obliged to save energy. The portion of the energy we are sharing for our use need not be wasted. For focusing on the energy conservation topic.</p>
            <p>Energy conservation is a hot topic for the world. There are various forms of energy available on earth. For mankind, it is important to know the importance of energies available. Electricity, fuels, nuclear power plants, windmills, etc are the forms of energy sources for common use. The wise use of these forms of energy is necessary. The cutting down of energy consumption is beneficial for all of us.</p>
            <p>As you see in the table we was comparing about the Renawable and the non-renawable and giving some examples about them amd there is more like for the Renawable energy source Biomass, Geothermal and Hydropower. The non-renawable are Nuclear and Natural Gas.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Energy and Climate Change Research</h2>
           <p>Changes in how we produce and use energy can have significant impacts on human health and affect air and water quality and other measures of environmental quality. Energy technologies are changing rapidly, improving efficiency and environmental sustainability. EPA researchers are improving our understanding of how changes in energy production and use can impact climate change and the environment and how climate change can impact energy production. The ways that energy is produced and used are changing in many areas, including:</p>
           <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Growing numbers of vehicles that use electricity</li>
                  <li>More electricity generation from wind and solar plants</li>
                  <li>Substantial use of biofuels</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>It is important to understand how increasing or decreasing one source of energy can affect the other sources and lead to different consequences for the environment. Using wind power to generate electricity, for example, changes how and when electricity is needed from other types of power plants, which can affect the environment in multiple ways. For instance, biofuels do not generate as much carbon dioxide (Co<sup>2</sup>) as gasoline, but production of crops for biofuels requires more land area and uses more water than production of the same amount of energy in the form of gasoline.</p>
